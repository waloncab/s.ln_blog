<p>
    Transformations are at the core of any rendering engine. 
    Vectors and matrices are the basic data structures that allow to
    desgin and create functions to transform set of points in certain geometric way.
</p>

<h3> Points / Vectors / Matrices</h3>
<p>
    Both points and vectors are represented by a list of numbers, but they have different geometric interpretations.
    Points are simple a defined position in a space but vectors represent a direction within that space.
    Matrices are the best mathematical construct to apply transformations to the points and vectors, GPUs are highly optimized
    to compute matrix multiplications in parallel.
</p>

<h3> What kind of operations are needed in the 3D space ? </h3>

<p>Well, in any rendering engine, we require the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>translation</li>
    <li>rotation</li>
    <li>scale</li>
</ul>

<p> Keep reding the text and imagine that transformations are applied from the origin of the coordinate system (global coordinates), 
    we'll consider local transformations later  </p>

<h3>4x4 Matrix in a 3D Space</h3>

<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneuos coordinates</a> are a system of coordinates used in projective geometry.
    They have the advantage that the coordinates of points, including points at infinity, can be represented using finite coordinates.
    Since translation is not a linear transformation we need to embed 3x3 matrices in a 4x4 matrices, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry)">find out why</a>
</p>

<h3> Basic Transformation Matrices</h3>

<p>
For any given object we need to translate, rotate, and scale. Each one of this scene objects need to store transformation data in a 4x4 matrix. 
The matrix multiplication allow to easily modify the transformation data the object stores.
The following blocks of code create the most basic matrices in numpy arrays.
</p>

<h3>Model Matrix</h3>

    <p>
    A matrix is used to store the transformation of any object, but what about the points / vertices of that object in the case that 
    it renders some kind of mesh ?
    </p>

    <p>Storing the transformation in the model matrix allows : </p>

    <ul>
        <li>chain transformations by multiplying the model matrix of the object, the result matrix will store the acumulated transformatins.</li>
        <li>render a complex mesh without having to store the vertices of the mesh inside the object.</li>
    </ul>

        [1, 0, 0, 0],

        [0 ,0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ]).astype(float)</code></pre></figure>

        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ]).astype(float)</code></pre></figure>

<p>
    The followings lines of code represent the rotation matrices for the x,y,z axes.
    Rotation happens around an axis, and the rotation matrix does not move the axis.
    Rotation can be produced arond any vector, but we are considering just the rotation around the 
    basis vectors (axis) since other roations can be derived later from the world matrix.

<h3> Local vs Global Coordinates </h3>

<p>
    When we multiply any of the previous matrices by some point we are transforming that point in a global coordinate system (Origin(0,0,0)). 
    For example, when multiplying a point by the translation matrix the point moves along the basis x,y,z axis.
    Local transformations requiere to define an internal local coordinate system. Origin, orientation, and scale of the
    local coordinate axes are chosen for conviniece, but usually the center of the object is selected to transform locally.
</p>

<h3> How to use matrix multiplication to perform transformations in Local Coordinate Systems </h3>

    <p>
        Let's keep it simple, in order to perform any global transformation we chain matrix multiplications on the left side of expression.
        To achive local transformations just multiply on the right side of the expression. 
        Keep in mind that matrix multiplication is not commutative: A*B != B*A 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Global Transformation: T3 * T2 * T1 * M(model_matrix)</li>
        <li>Local Transformation: M(model_matrix) * T1 * T2 * T3</li>

        This spline plot has been generated using <a href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>. There are many scenarios where a completly graphics engine is not necesary. Static visualization can be accomplished with simple libraries such as this one.
    </p>

    <p>
        Keep in mind what your target platforms for the plots are, and then have a look what fits your project best. In this case plotly instead of matplotlib or seaborn, allow simple html export with the full plotting toolbar. This small features make a difference when it comes to the export, have a look at the <a href="https://plotly.com/python/interactive-html-export/"> documentation</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Now we are going to plot the data. Transform it into X and Y components, then use the Plotly commands to setup the axis and show it.
        This code has been copied from Jupyter notebook cell, use this notebooks to keep code and plotting data organized before auploading to remote servers.

    <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-pyhton" data-lang="pyhton">    import plotly.express as px
    
    fig = px.line(
        x = np.squeeze(np.asarray(X)), 
        y = np.squeeze(np.asarray(Y))
        )

    # scale the axis properly

    fig.update_yaxes(
        scaleanchor = "x",
        scaleratio = 1,
    )
    
    fig.show()

    </code></pre></figure>

    <p>
        After plotting the data, we need to export the generated graph to an html format. The following snippet does so.
