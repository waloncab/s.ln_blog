        "content": "    Transformations are at the core of any rendering engine.     Vectors and matrices are the basic data structures that allow to    desgin and create functions to transform set of points in certain geometric way. Points / Vectors / Matrices    Both points and vectors are represented by a list of numbers, but they have different geometric interpretations.    Points are simple a defined position in a space but vectors represent a direction within that space.    Matrices are the best mathematical construct to apply transformations to the points and vectors, GPUs are highly optimized    to compute matrix multiplications in parallel. What kind of operations are needed in the 3D space ? Well, in any rendering engine, we require the following:    translation    rotation    scale Keep reding the text and imagine that transformations are applied from the origin of the coordinate system (global coordinates),     we'll consider local transformations later  4x4 Matrix in a 3D Space homogeneuos coordinates are a system of coordinates used in projective geometry.    They have the advantage that the coordinates of points, including points at infinity, can be represented using finite coordinates.    Since translation is not a linear transformation we need to embed 3x3 matrices in a 4x4 matrices, find out why Basic Transformation MatricesFor any given object we need to translate, rotate, and scale. Each one of this scene objects need to store transformation data in a 4x4 matrix. The matrix multiplication allow to easily modify the transformation data the object stores.The following blocks of code create the most basic matrices in numpy arrays.Model Matrix        A matrix is used to store the transformation of any object, but what about the points / vertices of that object in the case that     it renders some kind of mesh ?        Storing the transformation in the model matrix allows :             chain transformations by multiplying the model matrix of the object, the result matrix will store the acumulated transformatins.        render a complex mesh without having to store the vertices of the mesh inside the object.    def init_Identity():    return np.array( [        [1, 0, 0, 0],        [0, 1, 0, 0],        [0 ,0, 1, 0],        [0, 0, 0, 1]    ]).astype(float)def init_Translation(x,y,z):    return np.array( [        [1, 0, 0, x],        [0, 1, 0, y],        [0 ,0, 1, z],        [0, 0, 0, 1]    ]).astype(float)    The followings lines of code represent the rotation matrices for the x,y,z axes.    Rotation happens around an axis, and the rotation matrix does not move the axis.    Rotation can be produced arond any vector, but we are considering just the rotation around the     basis vectors (axis) since other roations can be derived later from the world matrix.def init_RotationX(angle):    c = cos(angle)    s = sin(angle)    return np.array( [        [1, 0,  0, 0],        [0, c, -s, 0],        [0 ,s,  c, 0],        [0, 0,  0, 1]    ]).astype(float)def init_RotationY(angle):    c = cos(angle)    s = sin(angle)    return np.array( [        [ c, 0, s, 0],        [ 0, 1, 0, 0],        [-s ,0, c, 0],        [ 0, 0, 0, 1]    ]).astype(float)def init_RotationZ(angle):    c = cos(angle)    s = sin(angle)    return np.array( [        [c, -s, 0, 0],        [s, c, 0, 0],        [0 ,0, 1, 0],        [0, 0, 0, 1]    ]).astype(float)    This scale matrix only accepts one parameter scaling the object uniformly along the x,y, axes.def init_Scale(s):    return np.array( [        [s, 0, 0, 0],        [0, s, 0, 0],        [0 ,0, s, 0],        [0, 0, 0, 1]    ]).astype(float) Local vs Global Coordinates     When we multiply any of the previous matrices by some point we are transforming that point in a global coordinate system (Origin(0,0,0)).     For example, when multiplying a point by the translation matrix the point moves along the basis x,y,z axis.    Local transformations requiere to define an internal local coordinate system. Origin, orientation, and scale of the    local coordinate axes are chosen for conviniece, but usually the center of the object is selected to transform locally. How to use matrix multiplication to perform transformations in Local Coordinate Systems             Let's keep it simple, in order to perform any global transformation we chain matrix multiplications on the left side of expression.        To achive local transformations just multiply on the right side of the expression.         Keep in mind that matrix multiplication is not commutative: A*B != B*A                 Global Transformation: T3 * T2 * T1 * M(model_matrix)        Local Transformation: M(model_matrix) * T1 * T2 * T3        Perspective matrix for rendering the scene.

There are a few layers that composes the web, having jekyll as the backend and standard html, css, and javascript on the front-end.Since jekyll is a lightweight static web page generator, the site has to be built before uploading it to any remote server. This is a very repetitive process that could be automated.In this blog post we are going to see a simple way to use git version control from Pyhton and upload the built web-page to github and then enable github-pages.Steps:  use [ jekyll bundle build ] to build the web page into the _site folder.  copy the _site folder to some other folder and start a git repository in there.  automate the git commit with the following lines of code.Make sure you have previously installed the corresponding git package into your Python ( use pip install )    pip install GitPythonThe following lines specify the basic operations that can be done with your repository.

There are many scenarios where a completly graphics engine is not necesary. Static visualization can be accomplished with simple libraries such as this one.                Keep in mind what your target platforms for the plots are, and then have a look what fits your project best. In this case plotly instead of matplotlib or seaborn, allow simple html export with the full plotting toolbar. This small features make a difference when it comes to the export, have a look at the  documentation                Now we are going to plot the data. Transform it into X and Y components, then use the Plotly commands to setup the axis and show it.        This code has been copied from Jupyter notebook cell, use this notebooks to keep code and plotting data organized before auploading to remote servers.            import plotly.express as px        fig = px.line(        x = np.squeeze(np.asarray(X)),         y = np.squeeze(np.asarray(Y))        )    # scale the axis properly    fig.update_yaxes(        scaleanchor = \"x\",        scaleratio = 1,    )        fig.show()                After plotting the data, we need to export the generated graph to an html format.

        "content": "We can define a domain-specific language (DSL) as a programming language specialized to a particular application domain.In this blog post we understand some key concepts and use cases inside the lines framework.An interface was needed for programable movement along lines. In this specific case a custom DSLallows to program simple instructions without understanding any of the inner working of the framework.There is a sharp definition between the general purpose language that host the framework and thedomain specific language stored in scripts that can later be process. Encapsulating instructions in scripts make this kind of code highly reusable along different components.We are using an expression builder to construct the graph that represents a movement state machine.In this case we are not working with simple value assignments or defined instructions. The DSL represents a complex data structure, expression builders need to be defined for each new sentence.Lets analyze a fluent API and the elements we are using here.ExpressionBuilder builder = new ExpressionBuilder();builder.loop()            .times(5)            .set(new ExpressionBuilder()                .sequence()                    .add(new ExpressionBuilder().terminal&lt;MoveBuilder&gt;()                            .distance(1)                        .move_end()                    )                    .add(new ExpressionBuilder().terminal&lt;MoveBuilder&gt;()                            .min(-5)                            .max(5)                        .move_end()                    )                    .add(new ExpressionBuilder()                        .decide()                            .add(0.3f, new ExpressionBuilder().terminal&lt;MoveBuilder&gt;()                                    .min(-8)                                    .max(8)                                .move_end()                            )                            .add(0.7f, new ExpressionBuilder().terminal&lt;MoveBuilder&gt;()                                    .distance(10)                                .move_end()                            )                        .decide_end()                    )                .sequence_end()            )        .loop_end()    .end();return builder.Generate();This expression tree builds a complex graph State-Machine.The fluent interface allows to link instructions in a natural expressive way.Notice the difference between the terminal and non-terminal expressions.      Terminal:  Represent the behavior we want to add to the graph.        Non-Terminal:  Integrate flow control with elements such as loop, sequences and decisions.  Fluent APIs are popular among DSL, according to Wikipedia a fluent API is a way of implementing object oriented code with a more natural and human readable interface. Method chaining is used to relay the instruction context of a subsequent expression.But there are more elements to consider in those concrete languages.  Method Chaining  Method Cascading  Progressive Interfaces",

        "content": "There are different things that have been done with procedural content.Here we are going to see some basic classifications and where the different generative styles fit in. The few listed below are some important concepts that need to be understand before jumping into any particular case.      Generative Art    Is the art that has been created using a random process. The artist uses the system to indicate   how the result piece should look like. Consider a generative system as a tool someone uses to  define rules that tells the software how to generate some content.        Infinite Games    Many games or graphics projects create the world as the player walks through new areas.  Its a very interesting effect since a wide range of algorithms are available.   A very intersted concept is the Level of Detail (LOD), since the world need to be   optimezed and just render in the case of the player is using it.        Random Generation    Within every generative process random numbers are involved, but these are usually not enough.  A seed is requierd to add a more natural look to the thing we are trying to generate.  Perlin noise works great if used with different seeds to achive unique textures or functions  that can later be applied to meshes for example.        Procedural generation    It is about letting algorithms create content, and in some specific cases, in real-time.  In the case of LOD, highly optimized systems are required. We do not want to render or generate  any of the things the player is net able to see.  Keep reading the following blog posts for more about lines and the things you can do with them.Some of the use cases where the procedural generation has been useful:  shapes  endless generation  motion graphics  hills  nodes",

Given an interpolation parameter t, the coordinates of the respective points can be calculated with a concrete formula.Parameters:  t: the interpolation state [0 - 1]  w: weight values in the same dimensions, all x coordinate values, for example.This simple function returns the point coordinate for the interpolation value.However, notice the output and weights are floats, what means that we are constructing the curve for each coordinate independently, {X, Y, Z}public static float Bezier_3 (float t, float[] w){  if (w.Length != 4) {    throw new ArgumentException (\"List should have 4 points to be a cubic bezier\");  }  float t2 = t * t;  float t3 = t2 * t;  float mt = 1-t;  float mt2 = mt * mt;  float mt3 = mt2 * mt;  return w[0]*mt3 + 3*w[1]*mt2*t + 3* w[2]*mt*t2 + w[3]*t3;}Once the parameters are independent from the world-space, we can better optimize and generate concrete bezier functions for 2D or 3D space. Have a detail look on how the previous function is used to construct the curve for 3D space. Now, if the use case is a simple 2D space, we can remove the correspondent weights from the {Z} coordinate.Notice that a reasonable computation time is saved.public static Vector3 getPoint(List&lt;Vector3&gt; points, float t){  if (points.Count != 4) {    throw new ArgumentException (\"List should have 4 points to be a cubic bezier\");  }  float[] w_x = null; float[] w_y = null; float[] w_z = null;  decompose_weight (points, ref w_x, ref w_y, ref w_z);  float x = Bezier_3(t, w_x);  float y = Bezier_3(t, w_y);  float z = Bezier_3(t, w_z);  return new Vector3 (x, y, z);}The decompose weights instructions just reorganizes the List {X;Y;Z} components intoseparated lists containing the individual space coordinate for each one.",

        "content": "What traversing splines looks like?Interpolation in one of the core features of graphics development, you have it almost in every small tool that the game engine contains.Within the spline framework a linear interpolation is used to traverse shapes. Lets see some of the most relevant types of interpolation:  linear interpolation  polynomial interpolation  spline interpolation  Hermite interpolationDo not mistake the fact that within a spline a linear interpolation is used to go from the start to the end of the curve.In fact we use this linear approach for any iterable line / curve. A spline interpolation could be used to move an object alonga spline.Linear interpolation is the basic tool used in many cases. It interpolates at a constant pace from point a to point b.double interpolate_linear (double y1, double y2, double mu){   return(y1*(1-mu)+y2*mu);}Cubic interpolation is widely used when the movement needs some smooth look (polynomial interpolation).double interpolate_cubic(double y0, double y1, double y2, double y3, double mu){   double a0,a1,a2,a3,mu2;   mu2 = mu*mu;   a0 = y3 - y2 - y0 + y1;   a1 = y0 - y1 - a0;   a2 = y2 - y0;   a3 = y1;   return(a0*mu*mu2+a1*mu2+a2*mu+a3);}What other scenarios is interpolation used?  For any animation whether 2d or 3d, interpolation is used inside the skeleton model.  Inside camera movement interpolation allows smooth follow behavior.  Dynamic movement NPC’s constantly use interpolation to adapt the chasing movement.",
